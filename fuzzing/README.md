## Fuzzing Payloads

Many of these may contain variables. These will be the same variables for convenience throughout all of them. 

```
{domain}
{goodDomain}
{payload}
{path}
{file}
{separator}
```

When using these against your targets you can either match and replace these ahead of time, or simply set Match and Replace rules when using these lists in Burp Intruder.
